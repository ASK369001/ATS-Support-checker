ATS Resume Checker Documentation
================================

Overview
--------

The ATS Resume Checker is a web-based tool designed to evaluate resumes for compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). It analyzes uploaded resume files (in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format) and provides a compatibility score out of 10, along with identified issues and suggested improvements. The tool uses simple heuristics and text extraction (for PDFs) to assess key ATS-friendly attributes.

### Purpose

-   Help job seekers ensure their resumes are optimized for ATS parsing.

-   Provide actionable feedback to improve resume formatting and content.

### Features

-   File Upload: Accepts .pdf, .doc, and .docx files (full analysis only for PDFs).

-   ATS Compatibility Scoring: Assigns a score (0-10) based on predefined criteria.

-   Issue Detection: Identifies potential ATS compatibility problems.

-   Improvement Suggestions: Offers specific recommendations to address issues.

-   Text Extraction: Uses pdf.js to extract and analyze text from PDF files.

Usage
-----

1.  Open the Tool:

-   Load ats-resume-checker.html in a browser.

3.  Upload a Resume:

-   Click the file input and select a .pdf, .doc, or .docx file.

-   Click the "Check ATS Compatibility" button.

7.  Review Results:

-   Score: Displayed as "ATS Compatibility Score: X/10".

-   Issues: Listed if any are found (e.g., "Missing keyword: skills").

-   Success Message: Shown if no issues are detected.

* * * * *

Limitations
-----------

-   File Type Support: Full analysis is limited to PDFs due to pdf.js. DOC/DOCX files are only checked for format.

-   Keyword Simplicity: Only checks for exact matches of "experience," "skills," and "education."

-   Basic Formatting Check: Line break detection is rudimentary and may flag well-formatted resumes.

-   No Server-Side Processing: Runs entirely client-side, limiting advanced analysis.

* * * * *

Future Enhancements
-------------------

1.  Support for DOC/DOCX: Integrate libraries like mammoth.js for text extraction from Word files.

2.  Advanced Keyword Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) to detect synonyms or context.

3.  Formatting Detection: Improve checks for fonts, bullet points, and section headings.

4.  Custom Keywords: Allow users to input job-specific keywords for tailored analysis.

5.  Visual Feedback: Highlight issues directly on a rendered version of the resume.

* * * * *

Troubleshooting
---------------

-   "Error processing file": Ensure the uploaded PDF is not corrupted or password-protected.

-   No Output: Verify an internet connection (for pdf.js) and that a file was selected.

Score Seems Off: Check the resume content against the scoring criteria.
